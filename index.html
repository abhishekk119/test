          Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> with a
          strong foundation in
          <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS</strong>. I
          love crafting beautiful, responsive, and interactive web experiences
          that not only look stunning but also deliver seamless functionality.
          My keen eye for design and animation allows me to bring creativity and
          life to user interfaces, ensuring engaging and intuitive interactions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond front-end development, I have a solid understanding of
          <strong>Python and C</strong>, which helps me appreciate both
          high-level and low-level programming concepts. My engineering
          background in
          <strong>Information Technology from VIT University, Vellore</strong>,
          has equipped me with problem-solving skills, a structured approach to
          coding, and the ability to adapt to new technologies quickly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m also an <strong>expert in the Windows operating system</strong>,
          with deep knowledge of system configurations, optimizations, and
          troubleshooting. This expertise allows me to bridge the gap between
          software development and system-level efficiency, ensuring smooth
          performance for both applications and workflows.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What Drives Me?</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Design & Animation</strong>: I believe that great design is
          more than aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about usability and storytelling. I enjoy
          working with animations to create fluid, dynamic user experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Clean & Efficient Code</strong>: Writing maintainable and
          scalable code is a priority for me. I follow best practices to ensure
          performance and readability.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Continuous Learning</strong>: Technology evolves rapidly, and
          I make it a point to stay updated with the latest trends in front-end
          development, UI/UX design, and programming.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Problem-Solving</strong>: Whether itâ€™s debugging a tricky
          JavaScript issue or optimizing a React component, I thrive on
          challenges that push me to think critically.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>What I Bring to the Table?</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>âœ” Front-End Expertise</strong>: Proficient in modern
          frameworks like React and utility-first CSS with Tailwind.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong> âœ” Design Sensibility</strong>: A strong sense of layout,
          typography, and motion design to create visually appealing interfaces.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong> âœ” Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge</strong>: Understanding of
          back-end concepts (Python) and system-level programming (C) for a
          holistic development approach.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong> âœ” Windows Mastery</strong> Ability to optimize, troubleshoot,
          and customize Windows environments for peak performance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute
          to open-source initiatives, and explore new opportunities where I can
          apply my skills to build something impactful. Letâ€™s connect and create
          something amazing together! ðŸš€
          <br />
          <br />
          Feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to chat about tech, design, or
          anything in between. ðŸ˜Š
